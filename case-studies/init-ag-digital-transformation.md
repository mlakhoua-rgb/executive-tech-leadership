# Case Study: A 14-Year Digital Transformation Journey at Init AG

## Executive Summary

As Senior Manager of Operational Excellence for EMEA at Init AG, an international IT consulting leader, I led a 14-year journey of sustained growth and profitability. I managed a **€13M P&L** with a **40% EBIT** margin, turning the infrastructure division into a strategic profit center. A core achievement of this tenure was maintaining **100% client retention** over 14 years by consistently delivering value and operational excellence to key clients such as the **European Patent Office (EPO)**, **Stuttgart Stock Exchange**, and **NATO**.

## The Challenge: From Cost Center to Profit Center

When I joined, the infrastructure and operations division was viewed as a cost center. The primary challenges were:

-   **Profitability**: The division was not contributing to the company's bottom line.
-   **Client Value**: Services were seen as a commodity, with limited strategic value to clients.
-   **Operational Efficiency**: Manual processes and a reactive approach to operations led to inefficiencies and higher costs.
-   **Team Morale**: The team was siloed and lacked a clear sense of purpose and ownership.

## The Solution: A Long-Term Strategy for Value Creation

My strategy was to transform the division into a high-value, client-centric, and profitable business unit through a focus on operational excellence, strategic partnerships, and continuous improvement.

### 1. Financial & P&L Management

-   **Took full ownership of the €13M P&L**, implementing rigorous financial controls and a data-driven approach to decision-making.
-   **Developed a new pricing model** based on value delivered rather than cost-plus, which significantly improved margins.
-   **Implemented FinOps practices** to optimize resource utilization and reduce operational costs by **15%**.

### 2. Client-Centric Service Delivery

-   **Restructured the service delivery model** to align with client business objectives, moving from a reactive support model to a proactive partnership.
-   **Led the delivery for major European clients**, ensuring strict SLA/SLO governance and 100% security audit compliance (BSI IT-Grundschutz, ADSIC).
-   **Supported strategic bids and C-level presentations**, contributing to over **€10M+ in contracts won annually**.

### 3. DevOps & Automation Transformation

-   **Led the adoption of DevOps and IaC** across the organization, training over 600+ employees on Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, and Terraform.
-   **Automated the service delivery pipeline** using Puppet, Ansible, and CI/CD, which improved reliability and reduced manual effort.
-   **Led regulated digital transformations** for healthcare and government clients, including the Health Authority Abu Dhabi.

## The Results: A Legacy of Profitability and Trust

The 14-year journey at Init AG resulted in a complete transformation of the infrastructure division:

| Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **P&L Performance** | **€13M P&L with 40% EBIT** |
| **Client Retention** | **100% over 14 years** |
| **Contract Wins** | **€10M+ annually** |
| **Cost Reduction** | **15% through automation** |
| **Team Growth** | **Led a team of 16 staff** |

## Lessons Learned

-   **Long-term vision is key**: Transforming a business unit takes time, patience, and a consistent, long-term vision.
-   **Trust is the ultimate currency**: 100% client retention is not an accident; it's the result of consistently delivering on promises and building deep, trust-based relationships.
-   **Empowerment drives profitability**: By empowering the team and giving them ownership, we unlocked new levels of innovation and efficiency that directly impacted the bottom line.
-   **Value-based pricing changes the game**: Shifting the conversation from cost to value allows you to capture a fair share of the value you create for clients.
