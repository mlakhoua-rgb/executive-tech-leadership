# Case Study: The Sandbox - Scaling Web3 Infrastructure for 8M+ Users

## Executive Summary

-   **Company:** The Sandbox (a subsidiary of Animoca Brands)
-   **Role:** Global Director of Platforms & Cloud Operations
-   **Duration:** October 2022 - October 2025
-   **Team Size:** 144 engineers across 24 international squads in 5 countries
-   **Business Impact:** Supported the growth of the metaverse platform to 8M+ users and 400+ global brand partners, including Warner Music, Gucci, Ubisoft, and Adidas.

## Business Challenge

The Sandbox was experiencing explosive growth, and its infrastructure was struggling to keep up. The platform needed to scale rapidly to support millions of users, while also providing a reliable and secure experience for its high-profile brand partners. The key challenges were:

-   **Scalability:** The existing infrastructure was not designed to handle the massive influx of users and the increasing complexity of the metaverse.
-   **Reliability:** The platform was experiencing frequent outages and performance issues, which were impacting user experience and damaging the company's reputation.
-   **Security:** As a high-profile Web3 platform, The Sandbox was a prime target for cyberattacks. The company needed to implement a robust security posture to protect its users, its partners, and its intellectual property.
-   **Compliance:** The platform needed to comply with a complex web of regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and various financial regulations.
-   **Cost:** The infrastructure costs were spiraling out of control, and the company needed to find a way to optimize its spending without sacrificing performance or reliability.

## Leadership Approach

My approach was to build a world-class platform engineering organization that could provide the scalability, reliability, security, and compliance that the business needed. I focused on three key areas:

1.  **People:** I restructured the organization into 24 cross-functional squads, each with a clear mission and a high degree of autonomy. I hired and developed top talent, and I created a culture of collaboration, innovation, and accountability.
2.  **Process:** I implemented a modern, agile development process based on DevOps and SRE principles. We automated everything from infrastructure provisioning to application deployment, and we used data to drive our decisions and measure our success.
3.  **Technology:** I led the migration to a multi-cloud architecture based on AWS and Azure. We used a variety of cloud-native technologies, including Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform, to build a scalable, resilient, and secure platform.

## Technical Strategy

Our technical strategy was to build a cloud-native platform that could scale to meet the demands of the metaverse. The key components of our strategy were:

-   **Multi-Cloud:** We used a multi-cloud strategy to avoid vendor lock-in and to take advantage of the best features of each cloud provider. We used AWS for our core infrastructure and Azure for our data and analytics workloads.
-   **Kubernetes:** We used Kubernetes to orchestrate our containerized applications. This allowed us to scale our applications up and down as needed, and it provided a high degree of resilience and fault tolerance.
-   **Infrastructure as Code:** We used Terraform to manage our infrastructure as code. This allowed us to automate the provisioning of our infrastructure, and it ensured that our infrastructure was consistent and repeatable.
-   **CI/CD:** We built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that allowed us to deploy new code to production multiple times a day. This allowed us to iterate quickly and to get new features into the hands of our users as fast as possible.
-   **Observability:** We implemented a comprehensive observability stack based on Datadog, Prometheus, and Grafana. This gave us deep insights into the performance of our platform, and it allowed us to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Key Achievements

-   **Scaled the platform to support 8M+ users and 400+ brand partners.**
-   **Improved platform uptime from 99.9% to 99.99%.**
-   **Reduced P1 incident response time from >1 hour to <15 minutes.**
-   **Increased deployment frequency from once a month to 20+ times a day.**
-   **Reduced infrastructure costs by $250K annually through FinOps practices.**
-   **Achieved SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001 compliance.**
-   **Built a high-performing team of 144 engineers across 24 squads.**

## Lessons Learned

-   **Culture is everything:** Building a strong engineering culture is the most important thing you can do to ensure the success of your platform.
-   **Automation is key:** You can't scale a platform like The Sandbox without a high degree of automation.
-   **Data is your friend:** Use data to drive your decisions and to measure your success.
-   **Don't be afraid to fail:** The only way to innovate is to be willing to take risks and to learn from your mistakes.
-   **Invest in your people:** Your team is your most valuable asset. Invest in their development and create an environment where they can do their best work.
